WordPress Plugin for WP-e-commerce 3.8

* "WP E-Commerce Role Discount" creates a role for premium customers.
* You can manually create users and associate them to this role or change the role of registered customers to "Premium User".
* On the product dialog you'll see a Meta Box to define a price for premium customers for each product. (see screenshot 1)
* Your customers will see the normal price and the premium price. This plugin uses the formatting for special prices, so you don't have to change your theme.
